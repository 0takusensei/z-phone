# Z-Phone

Welcome to **Z-Phone**, the open-source initiative that transforms the in-game mobile experience in FiveM by introducing a sleek, iPhone-inspired design that prioritizes simplicity and elegance.

## Objective

Our goal is to create a visually appealing and user-friendly phone interface that enhances the gameplay experience without overwhelming players. By focusing on essential features and an intuitive layout, we hope to make communication in the game more enjoyable and immersive.
